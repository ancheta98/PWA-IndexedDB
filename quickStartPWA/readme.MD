# Quick start to PWA 

PWA is a relatively huge topic so while quick is in the title, that surely may not be the case when setting up (It wasn't for me!). So don't be discouraged if you don't complete this as quickly as you wanted to, nothing in life worth having comes quickly (or something like that). In addition to offline features we can make our app look like a native app for phones (Instagram is PWA bet you never noticed!). I will touch on that conceptually but the main focus here will be on offline use.

Sidenote: Most browsers support PWA just be careful if you or your audience is using Safari or IE (smh keep up Apple). That being said you should use Chrome, I am using Chrome so to get the most consistency please jump on the Chrome train at least for this guide!

### Let's start with the manifest.json

["The web app manifest is a JSON file that tells the browser about your Progressive Web App and how it should behave when installed on the user's desktop or mobile device. A typical manifest file includes the app name, the icons the app should use, and the URL that should be opened when the app is launched."](https://web.dev/add-manifest/ "The first reading in the list of sources also mentions this!")

There are a ton of cool things this file can do for us for example<sup><strong>1</strong></sup>:

- ```display``` in its own window
- tell the page what page to open when the user visits it ```start_url```
- tell what ```orientation``` it should be in
- Lots more!

The manifest.json in this app just has a few icons for now, that's really all that's important for now



### Now on to the Service Worker ðŸ˜±

JK, it's really not that scary. In short the Service Worker's normal run through can be summated down to three events: Registration -> Installation -> Activation

1) Registration: We tell the browser that it should be aware of the Service Worker and that it will need to install it

```Code snippet here on registration```

2) Installation: When the browser detects that this is new or is different than the last time (if previously accessed) it was here it will try to install the service worker. We can use the event listener called 'install' to make this happen
    - 2a) After the initial page load users will benefit from PWA features! 

```code snippet here```

 3) Activation: Now that the service worker has been registered an installed it is considered activated via the 'activate' event listener! It is basically ready for use.
    - 3a) This is the place where we should delete any old, outdated stuff

```code snippet here```

##### Important to note: Refreshing the page will not properly update the Service Worker if changed or updated, you must close any tabs of your app and reopen it in a new tab/window. This will ensure that the old Service Worker has enough time to be considered out of use and so will be updated properly. Check out the service worker reading in the [Main Outline Readme](../readme.md)
